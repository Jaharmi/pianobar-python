pianobar-python

About
=====

This is a set of wrapper libraries and scripts designed to work with the
Pandora client "pianobar".  pianobar was originally created Lars-Dominik Braun,
and can be found at http://6xq.net/html/00/17.html

The main purpose of this project is to allow a more native/pretty interface to
pianobar, or at least from the perspective of a Gnome user.  The included
"daemon" script interfaces with Gnome's play/stop/next media keys so that the
user can control pianobar without having to find the right terminal window, or
while running pianobar from a disconnected screen session.


Usage
=====

Running the daemon script is as easy as running:

  python path/to/pianobar/daemon.py


Caveats
=======

This has only been tested on my own local system:
  Ubuntu 9.10 with pianobar compiled and installed to /usr/local/

Currently, the control system and daemon script require the user to already
have installed and started pianobar, and to have not modified any action keys.

The daemon script only works in Gnome, as it uses dbus to listen for Gnome's
media key signals.
